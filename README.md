### My Excel Course Experience ###

I recently completed an MS Excel course through www.mygreatLearning.com , and it has been a highly enriching experience. The course covered essential features of Excel, from basic functionalities to more advanced data analysis techniques. It was structured in a way that was easy to follow, with hands-on exercises that helped me grasp each concept effectively. The instructors were knowledgeable and provided practical insights that were directly applicable to real-world scenarios.

### Examples of Excel Course Function:
1. Sum Function:
- The Sum Function is used to add up a range of numbers.
- If you want to add cells from A1 to A7, you can use =SUM(A1:A7) to select all cells from A1 to A7 cell and can get the total.

2. MAX Function:
- The MAX Function returns the largest number in a range.
- Example: If we want to select largest value, we can use =MAX(A1:A7) and we will get the largest value.

3. MIN Function:
- The MIN Function is used to get the minimum value in a selected range.
- Example: To find minimum value in A1 to A10, we can use =MIN(A1:A10) and we will get the value.

4. Average Function:
- The Average function is used to get mean of selected number of cells.
- Example: To find Average or mean of 10 cells we can use, =AVERAGE(A1:A10) and after pressing enter we will get the average.

5. COUNT Function:
- The Count Function is used to count the number of cells which contain numbers in a specified range.
- Example: If you have some empty cells in slected range than you can use, =COUNT(A1:A10) the we will get number of cells having some values.
